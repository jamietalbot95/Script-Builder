# Script-Builder
A script builder GUI built using Python and Tkinter. Scripts will be used for networking equipment running Cisco and Vocality OS.

This program will read information from a txt template file (selected by the user) and prompt the user to complete different fields of information. This information will then be used to automatically populate the template file. A series of validation checks will be completed before the user is given the option to view the completed script. If the user is happy with the created script, they will then be able to save the script as a txt file. It is then ready to be uploaded to the relevent switch or router.

The program is designed to be flexible and allow for a random number of required fields to be entered.

Simple template files are provided for proof of concept.

Please note: Supplied scripts have been simplified to act as a proof of concept.
